When in-season, wild garlic is one of the best readily available ingredients around. I made this butter after [Jack](https://www.instagram.com/jacksails/) gave me some when he went on a picking spree. It's so simple and instantly lifts anything you cook in it.

## Ingredients

* A couple of bunches of wild garlic
* 250g block unsalted butter
* 2 tbsp Maldon sea salt

## Method

1. Get the butter out the fridge and allow to come to room temperature
1. Wash the wild garlic in cold water
1. Chop the wild garlic finely
1. Add the butter, garlic and salt into a mixer and blend
1. Tip mixture out onto baking parchment and roll into a log
1. Refrigerate until you're ready to use it

## Notes

Chuck a lump of it onto a resting steak after cooking.

## Inspiration

I don't know, but it's pretty obvious that butter and garlic is great, isn't it?
