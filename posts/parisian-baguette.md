A crusty baguette that, due to how it's fermented and prooved, is soft and airy on the inside. It's quite possible to eat the entire thing immediately with [Beurre d'Isigny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beurre_d%27Isigny) or as part of a [Jambom Beurre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jambon-beurre).
