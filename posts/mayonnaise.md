A good mayonnaise should be creamy, salty and with a hint of mustard. Perfect for crispy fries and as a base for other sauces (like [aioli](/aioli)).

## Ingredients

* 2 large egg yolks
* 250ml sunflower oil
* 2 tbsp Dijon mustard
* 2 tbsp white wine vinegar
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Method

1. Add the egg yolks and mustard to a food processor and blitz it until the base of an emulsion has formed
1. Start a slow and steady flow of the oil into the emulsion, take your time to ensure the emulsion doesn't thin out too much
1. Add the vinegar, salt and pepper to taste

## Notes

If the mixture doesn't thicken up enough, start again with one new egg yolk and slowly pour the thin mixture into the new base. The thickening mostly happens during the whisking and not because of more yolks, so it's easy to rescue it.
