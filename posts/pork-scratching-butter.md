This isn't really a recipe, just a stroke of genius. Ever since our friend made me aware of this, butter will never be the same again. It's butter, with powdered pork scratchings. A nice crunchy spread for fresh bread. Or mixed into steamed greens. Or on absolutely anything else.

## Ingredients

* 1 block of salted butter
* 2 packs of pork scratchings

## Method

1. Leave the butter out of the fridge to get to room temperature
1. Bash the pork scratchings up with a rolling pin. I did one pack into a fine powder and the other into larger chunks for more texture
1. Mix the two together, and season with a little more salt (or MSG) for that extra kick
