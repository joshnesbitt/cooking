Boiling a lobster is the simplest way to cook lobster and leaves you with the purest taste of the lobster meat. This is how I first started cooking lobster, and I'd say it's the quickest way to cook a lot of them if you're cooking a few at a time.

## Ingredients

* A live lobster
* A large pan of salted water

## Method

1. Bring the water to a rolling boil
1. [Humanely kill your lobster(s)](/lobster-humanely-killing)
1. Place the lobster in the water and start the timer (roughly 9 minutes for an 800g lobster, see below for a guide)
1. Once cooked, remove and leave for a few minutes to cool slightly
1. Crack open the claws, remove the tail meat and enjoy!

## Notes

Be careful the water doesn't boil over, as it may froth up over time.

If you're cooking more than one, you'll need to play with the times a bit. Suggested cooking times for a single lobster:

|Lobster Size|Boiling Times|
|------------|-------------|
|500g        |6 minutes    |
|600g        |7 minutes    |
|700g        |8 minutes    |
|800g        |9 minutes    |
|900g        |10 minutes   |
|1kg         |12 minutes   |
|1.5kg       |15 minutes   |
|2kg         |17 minutes   |

If you've overcooked the lobster, the claw meat will stick to the claws when you're trying to get the meat out.
