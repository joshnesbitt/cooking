This sauce is nothing more than a [traditional roux](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/how-make-roux) with truffle salsa in it, but it's a superb addition to any pasta or fried dish (like [arancini](/wild-mushroom-arancini-truffle-sauce)).

## Ingredients

* 2 tsp truffle salsa
* 100g salted butter
* 50g plain flour
* 1 pint whole milk

## Method

1. Melt the butter on a low heat in a pan
1. Add the flour and mix with the butter until you have a loose paste
1. Ensure you cook off the paste for a short while so the sauce doesn't taste like raw flour
1. Add the milk bit by bit, keeping it moving with a whisk. It will go through phases of being thick and loose, and as you introduce more milk and heat it will thicken up
1. It's important to keep the sauce moving to ensure no lumps form or the sauce starts to burn on the pan
1. Once the roux is finished, add the truffle salsa to taste, adding salt if needed

## Notes

You can prepare the sauce days in advance and reheat for serving by adding a bit of milk to loosen it up. If you burn the sauce, there's no saving it, start again.

## Inspiration

I first had this sauce at one of the [San Carlo](https://sancarlo.co.uk/) restaurants years ago, served with truffle ravioli, so I had to steal it to do it with [arancini](/wild-mushroom-arancini-truffle-sauce) at some point.
