title: Squash Soup with Bacon Crostini
description: Intro
---

Now the autumn weather is setting in soup is becoming a much more appealing option for lunch! I've never really liked soup on its own, I always want more texture to it, so I try to add some style of crouton or toasted seeds to make it a bit more interesting. I absolutely love croutons that are baked in tons of olive oil and salt, which means you can go easier on the salt in the actual soup.

This is definitely a recipe for batch preparation so you can knock up a quick lunch during the week.

## Ingredients

* 2 white potatoes
* 2 butternut squash
* 2 white onions
* 6 garlic cloves
* 1tbsp bouillon (or 2 vegetable stock cubes)
* 1 tbsp dried chilli
* 150ml double cream
* 1.2l boiling water
* 1 ciabatta loaf
* 6 rashers streaky bacon
* Olive oil

## Method

## Notes

Adding toasted seeds can be a nice way to introduce more protein (like sunflower or flaked almonds).
