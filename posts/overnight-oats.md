description: A simple, nutritional breakfast.
---

A tasty morning snack/breakfast that's simple to prepare. It's good to have some in the fridge if you're in a rush during the week.

## Ingredients

* 150g oats
* 2 grated apples
* 100g pomegranate seeds
* 150ml whole milk
* 100ml yogurt
* 30g honey
* Pinch of salt

## Method

1. Core and grate the apples
1. Mix the apple, pomegranate, salt and oats together
1. Combine the remaining wet ingredients
1. Leave in the fridge overnight
1. Serve the next morning with additional honey

## Notes

The oats will absorb a lot of the liquid, so if you prefer your oats a bit runnier you can add more milk.
