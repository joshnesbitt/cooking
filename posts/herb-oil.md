I was originally looking for a way to infuse oil with coriander for a fish tartare recipe when I discovered [this method][1]. Making the oil fresh really does dramatically change the flavour and is a nice way of introducing a herbs to a dish.

## Ingredients

* 200g fresh herbs (I used coriander)
* 400ml groundnut oil
* 1tsp Maldon sea salt

## Method

1. Blanch the bunch of herbs in a salted pan of boiling water for 30 seconds
1. Plunge the herbs straight from the boiling water into a bath of iced water and leave to cool completely
1. Drain any excess water from the herbs with kitchen roll
1. Add the herbs and half the oil to a food processor and blend until very fine
1. Add the salt and remaining herbs and blitz to a fine pulp
1. Drain the mixture through a muslin into a chilled bowl
1. Leave the mixture straining overnight to ensure every last drop has strained through the muslin
1. Transfer to a bottle and use within 2 weeks

## Notes

Ensure you leave the mixture to strain overnight so you get all of the oil and herb pigments for a more vibrant colour.

## Inspiration

I found [this recipe][1] which details the process of extracting the herb flavour into an oil.
