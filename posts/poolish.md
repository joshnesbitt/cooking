Poolish is the French word for a pre-ferment, or starter. A starter usually contains flour, water and a leavening agent (usually yeast or sourdough culture), and is added to a a dough instead of using yeast directly.

Using a starter can lead to a totally different texture in the bread you're making. I started researching Poolish while looking at how to create [Parisian Baguettes](/parisian-baguette), and a poolish is a key part of this recipe as you want the inside of the bread to be soft, chewy and airy.

The main thing you need for a pre-ferment is time. Time allows the yeast to work longer on the starch and proteins in the dough.

## Ingredients

* 200g bread flour
* 200g warm (but not hot) water
* 0.2g dry active yeast

## Method

1. Mix all the ingredients together
1. Store in a sealed container (or bowl with cling film covering it) for the designated rest period
1. Use as close to the end of fermentation as possible

## Notes

Due to the not-so-consistent weather in the UK I've dedicated my loft as my "proofing room" for the poolish. It's consistently warmer up there and I find the dried yeast reactivates well up there.

The [article I used as a reference][1] outlines the ratios of dried yeast to use against equal parts flour and water (both measured in weight).

|Fermentation time  |Ratio        |
|-------------------|-------------|
|8 hours in advance |0.23% – 0.33%|
|12 hours in advance|0.1% – 0.2%  |
|16 hours in advance|0.03% – 0.08%|

## Inspiration

There's a great article on [Weekend Bakery][1] that discusses Poolish (French) and Biga (Italian) pre-ferments, including more detail on the ratios to be using when making them. [Wikipedia][2] has some great information on pre-ferment too.
