description: A fresh and zingy gin-based cocktail.
type: drink
---

I love boozy cocktails. The Eastern Standard is a nice depature from the pure-alcohol ones I usually tend to order. With the cucumber, mint and lime, it's a fresh cocktail that must be served cold.

## Ingredients

* 3 thick slices of cucumber
* 3 mint leaves
* 50ml dry gin (I like No.3 London Dry Gin)
* 12.5ml lime juice
* 10ml sugar syrup

## Method

1. Muddle the cucumber and mint
1. Add the remaining ingredients
1. Shake with ice and strain into a coupe glass (strain through a fine sieve if you don't want fragments of mint in the finished drink)

## Notes

You can replace the gin in this recipe for vodka, if you prefer a cleaner, less botanical, taste.

## Inspiration

The Eastern Standard is one of [Soho House's house tonics](https://www.diffordsguide.com/cocktails/recipe/4685/eastern-standard-soho-house-tonic).
