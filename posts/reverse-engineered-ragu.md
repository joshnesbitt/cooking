description: A trial and error approach to finding the perfect pasta sauce.
---

I think one of my favourite plates of pasta is the Radiatori ragu dish from [Stuzzi](https://stuzzi.co.uk/leeds/). It's got everything you want from a dish of pasta. Chunky pasta, a rich sauce and shredded meat with some chunkier bits in it for some texture. This recipe was reverse engineered from the dishes I've had at Stuzzi but also some other sauces I've eaten in Puglia.

## Ingredients

* 1kg boneless pork shoulder (excess fat trimmed off)
* 1 white onion
* 2 carrots
* 4 sticks of celery
* 1 tbsp thyme
* 1 tbsp sage
* 1 tbsp rosemary
* 4 garlic cloves
* 4 tbsp tomato paste
* 8 fresh tomatoes
* 300ml red wine
* 200ml veal stock
* 100ml water
* 75g butter
* Olive oil
* Salt and pepper to taste

## Method

1. Select a Dutch oven pan with a lid for this recipe
1. Dice your onion, garlic, celery and carrots into small cubes and fry in the butter (your [mirepoix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirepoix))
1. Remove from the pan and add the pork shoulder (cut into large chunks) with the olive oil, brown the meat generously
1. Add the mirepoix back into the pan, and add the remaining ingredients, mix well
1. Cook at 120°C for 1.5 hours with the lid on
1. Give everything a good stir and return to the oven for another 1.5 hours
1. Give everything another stir and remove the lid, increase the oven temperature to 180°C
1. After 20 minutes, stir, rinse and repeat this for another hour (this allows the sauce to thicken and darken, increasing in intensity and flavour)
1. Remove from the oven and rest
1. With a fork, stir the sauce, breaking some of the chunks of pork up along the way, so you have different textures within the sauce
1. Either store the sauce for another day, or cook immediately with pasta

## Notes

If you want, you can ramp the temperature a bit more to reduce the longer cooking time, but you need to ensure you render the shoulder down enough so the meat shreds up.

## Inspiration

As mentioned, the best version of this sauce was originally discovered from [Stuzzi](https://stuzzi.co.uk/leeds/). But pasta sauces are highly subjective depending on who you speak to, so you need to do your own discovery work to some degree!
